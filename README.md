# small-games-plugin
A plugin where you can play small games such as Blackjack (and more) for free and fun!

The idea behind this browser plugin in development is to give the player a mini-game to play while they presumably wait for something (such as a video/movie premiere or their next
Zoom meeting) to pass the time. 

I started this off by following the official Google Chrome developer tutorial regarding the creation of extensions for the browser. It will support others
afterwards such as Firefox and perhaps even Opera and the rising Brave.
