# small-games-plugin
A plugin where you can play small games such as Blackjack (and more) for free and fun!

The idea behind this browser plugin in development is to give the player a mini-game to play while they presumably wait for something (such as a video/movie premiere or their next
Zoom meeting) to pass the time.
